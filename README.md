# DSA_Practice

A comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementations with detailed explanations, complexity analysis, and practical examples.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Sorting Algorithms
- **QuickSort**: Fast in-place divide-and-conquer sorting with O(n log n) average complexity

### Tree Data Structures  
- **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**: Efficient O(log n) range sum queries and point updates
- **Segment Tree**: Efficient range queries and range updates with O(log n) complexity

### Fundamental Concepts
- **Two's Complement & LSB**: Binary representation and bit manipulation fundamentals

## 🎯 How to Use This Repository

Each topic includes:
- **Theory**: Detailed explanation of how the algorithm works
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity breakdown
