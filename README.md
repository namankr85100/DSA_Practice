### Organization Best Practices

**Use Folders (Not Branches) Because:**
- ✅ All content accessible simultaneously
- ✅ Easy navigation and search
- ✅ Better for documentation
- ✅ Can use tags/folders for categorization

**Naming Conventions:**
- `ProblemName_Pattern.md` for problem guides
- `DataStructureName.md` for implementations
- `ConceptName.md` for theory

**File Structure:**
- Keep related problems together in folders
- Use descriptive README in each folder
- Add complexity comparisons in tables
- Include visual diagrams where helpful

## 💡 Tips for Learning

1. **Start with fundamentals** - Understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Analyze complexity first** - Always think about time/space tradeoffs
3. **Trace through examples** - Manual dry runs build intuition
4. **Implement variations** - Different approaches deepen understanding
5. **Solve related problems** - Pattern recognition is key to mastery
6. **Review regularly** - Spaced repetition helps retention
